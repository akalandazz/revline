## URL Patterns

The checkout system adds these URLs:

```
/checkout/                    # Start checkout
/checkout/contact/            # Contact information
/checkout/shipping/           # Shipping address
/checkout/billing/            # Billing address
/checkout/shipping-method/    # Shipping method selection
/checkout/payment/            # Payment information
/checkout/review/             # Order review
/checkout/success/<order_number>/  # Order confirmation
/checkout/orders/             # Order history
/checkout/orders/<order_number>/   # Order details
```

## Integration Points
